# Project Notes

## Opening notes from in-class planning and discord conversations:
- Basic Idea
    - Build a car emulation platform that allows basic features such as
        - driving
        - filling gas
        - navigating to basic places (home, gas station, work, store, etc)
    - incorporate design patterns to allow easier structuring of code 
    - make a gui to take the program out of the command line?
