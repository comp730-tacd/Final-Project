## COMP 730 Final Project

For our team's final project, we initially set out to create a text-based driving game. This game would allow users to select a car of their choice, travel to various locations, and perform actions such as filling the gas tank. Throughout the development phase of this project, we decided to expand the scope and attempt to create a GUI wrapper around the existing code base. This would allow for a smoother user experience as opposed to having to type out one's choices in a terminal. Python's tkinter library was utilized to develop this GUI application.

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/comp730-tacd/Final-Project.git
cd Final-Project
```

No additional dependencies are required. Our final project requires the usage of Python 3.7+ and is incompatible with Python 2.X.


### Usage
To launch the game, simply double click gui_manager.py or run this command in the project's directory:
```
python3 gui_manager.py
```

(DEPRECATED) To launch text-based version:
```
python3 manager.py
```
